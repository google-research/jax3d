Google Research has witnessed a proliferation of codebases for execution of NeRF
workloads at scale. Jax3d is a library for neural rendering in Jax and aims to
be a nimble NeRF ecosystem to support rapid prototyping, easy collaboration as
well as the publication of research code. This is an effort to refactor and
open-source the internal jax3d codebase.
